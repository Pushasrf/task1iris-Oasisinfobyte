Task-1 Iris Flower Classification 
The Iris Flower Classification task involves using machine learning to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset includes features like petal and sepal length and width for each flower, which serve as inputs to the model.
The goal is to train a model that accurately predicts the species of an iris based on its measurements, providing a straightforward introduction to supervised classification in machine learning.
